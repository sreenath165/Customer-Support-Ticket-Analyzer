# Customer Support Ticket Analyzer & Router

An AI-powered system that intelligently classifies and routes customer support tickets based on severity and priority using multi-agent architecture.

This project showcases how a real-world support workflow can be automated using prompt-based agents, structured outputs, and intelligent routing logic. It also includes a performance evaluation framework and a live Streamlit dashboard for insights.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Agent System**: Specialized AI agents for severity analysis and customer priority evaluation.
- **Structured Reasoning**: Each agent provides scores (1–10) along with clear explanations.
- **Routing Logic**: Smart rules route tickets to the right teams based on agent outputs.
- **Evaluation Framework**: Validates routing decisions against expected outcomes.
- **Auto Logging**: Logs each agent's input, output, and decision reasoning to `ai_chat_history.txt`.
- **Dashboard**: Interactive Streamlit dashboard with filters, charts, KPIs, and trends over time.
- **Scalable Input**: Supports dynamic ticket ingestion via `test_tickets.json`.
